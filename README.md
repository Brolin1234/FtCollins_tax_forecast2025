This model was primarily constructed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, select tax metrics and figures from the City of Fort Collins were also incorporated as they were provided to us for academic and research purposes.

Due to privacy concerns and the integrity of local government data, Fort Collins tax information is not publicly posted here. Requests for access to specific tax data are subject to the discretion of the State of Colorado and the Fort Collins City Council.
