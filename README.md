## Data Sources and Access

This model was constructed primarily using publicly available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In addition, select tax metrics and fiscal figures were incorporated based on internal data provided by the City of Fort Collins for academic and non-commercial research purposes.

Please note that **Fort Collins tax data referenced in this project is not publicly distributed in this repository**. This restriction is in place to maintain data integrity and to respect privacy and disclosure protocols observed by local government entities.

Access to specific municipal tax records or datasets is governed by the policies of the State of Colorado and the Fort Collins City Council. Requests for access should be made directly to the appropriate government agencies. This repository does not serve as a channel for distributing or reproducing restricted government data.
